# Campus Area Network Simulation â€“ Cisco Packet Tracer

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **Campus Area Network (CAN)** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The network model follows a structured **hierarchical design** suitable for a multi-building campus environment, ensuring scalability, security, and efficient management.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Build a realistic campus-wide network topology.
- Implement VLANs for traffic separation.
- Configure inter-VLAN routing and DHCP.
- Test end-to-end connectivity across all departments.

## ðŸ›  Features
- **Multi-VLAN Design** for different departments.
- **Router-on-a-Stick Configuration** for inter-VLAN communication.
- **DHCP Server Setup** for dynamic IP allocation.
- **Layer 3 Core Switching** for optimized routing.
- **Hierarchical Topology** for improved performance and scalability.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies
- **Cisco Packet Tracer**
- VLANs, Trunk Ports, Access Ports
- Static Routing & Inter-VLAN Routing
- DHCP Configuration
